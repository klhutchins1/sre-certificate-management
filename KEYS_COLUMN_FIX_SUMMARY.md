# Database Sync 'Keys' Column Issue Fix

## Problem Description
When starting the application, users encountered the following error during database sync operations:

```
ERROR - Failed to sync UPDATE operation for domain_dns_records:1033: Could not locate column in row for column 'keys'
WARNING - Conflict detected for domain_dns_records:1033: Could not locate column in row for column 'keys'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incompatible SQLAlchemy 2.0 result object handling. The code was using `result.keys()` directly on SQLAlchemy result objects, which was causing the following problems:

1. **Dictionary Access Issue**: In SQLAlchemy 2.0, result objects returned by `fetchone()` are not directly dictionary-like objects
2. **Keys() Method Confusion**: The `result.keys()` method was being treated as a column name rather than returning the actual column names
3. **Tuple vs Dictionary**: Result objects behave as tuples in SQLAlchemy 2.0, not dictionaries

## Solution
Fixed the result object access patterns in three key methods in `infra_mgmt/db/cache_manager.py`:

### 1. `_sync_insert` method (lines ~806-808)
**Before:**
```python
columns = list(result.keys())
values = [result[col] for col in columns]
```

**After:**
```python
columns = list(result._mapping.keys())
values = [result._mapping[col] for col in columns]
```

### 2. `_sync_update` method (lines ~822-824)
**Before:**
```python
columns = [col for col in list(result.keys()) if col != 'id']
update_data = {col: result[col] for col in columns}
```

**After:**
```python
columns = [col for col in list(result._mapping.keys()) if col != 'id']
update_data = {col: result._mapping[col] for col in columns}
```

### 3. `_copy_table_data` method (line ~258)
**Before:**
```python
columns = result.keys()
```

**After:**
```python
columns = list(result.keys())
```

### 4. `_resolve_conflict` method (lines ~857-858)
**Before:**
```python
local_time = getattr(local_result, timestamp_col)
remote_time = getattr(remote_result, timestamp_col)
```

**After:**
```python
local_time = local_result._mapping[timestamp_col]
remote_time = remote_result._mapping[timestamp_col]
```

## Technical Details
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Compatibility**: Used `result._mapping` to access column data as dictionary-like objects
- **Proper Column Access**: Replaced `getattr()` with direct mapping access for timestamp columns
- **List Conversion**: Ensured `result.keys()` returns are properly converted to lists when needed

## Testing
Created and ran a comprehensive test that verifies:
- ✅ Session creation works without errors
- ✅ Pending write operations can be added
- ✅ Sync operations complete successfully
- ✅ Force sync operations work correctly
- ✅ No 'keys' column errors appear in logs

## Results
After the fix:
- **Sync Operations**: Complete successfully with proper record counts
- **Error Messages**: No more "Could not locate column in row for column 'keys'" errors
- **Database Integrity**: All sync operations work correctly with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Performance**: No performance degradation, operations complete as expected

## Impact
This fix resolves the critical database sync issue that was preventing proper data synchronization between cache and network databases. Users can now start the application without encountering the 'keys' column error.
