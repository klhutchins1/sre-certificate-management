# Cache Manager Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Problem
The tests `test_cache_manager_cache_dir_creation` and `test_cache_manager_load_cache` were causing severe slowdowns, memory leaks, and required terminal kills due to expensive background operations.

## Root Cause
The `DatabaseCacheManager` class was starting background threads during initialization:

1. **`start_sync()`** - Started a background sync thread that continuously checks network availability and tries to sync with remote databases
2. **`start_db_worker()`** - Started a database worker thread for processing database operations
3. **`_is_network_available()`** - Continuously checked if remote databases were accessible
4. **`_setup_enhanced_session_manager()`** - Set up enhanced session tracking
5. **`_load_pending_writes_from_tracking()`** - Loaded pending database operations

These background threads:
- Continuously ran even after tests completed
- Made repeated network/filesystem checks
- Caused resource consumption and memory leaks
- Generated "Remote database not available, operating in offline mode" messages

## Solution
Added comprehensive mocking to prevent expensive background operations:

```python
@patch('infra_mgmt.db.cache_manager.DatabaseCacheManager.start_sync')
@patch('infra_mgmt.db.cache_manager.DatabaseCacheManager.start_db_worker')
@patch('infra_mgmt.db.cache_manager.DatabaseCacheManager._is_network_available')
@patch('infra_mgmt.db.cache_manager.DatabaseCacheManager._load_pending_writes_from_tracking')
@patch('infra_mgmt.db.cache_manager.DatabaseCacheManager._setup_enhanced_session_manager')
def test_cache_manager_cache_dir_creation(mock_enhanced_session, mock_load_pending, mock_network_available, 
                                         mock_start_db_worker, mock_start_sync, temp_cache_dir, remote_db_path):
    mock_network_available.return_value = False
    # ... rest of test
```

Fixed the following tests:
- `test_cache_manager_cache_dir_creation`
- `test_cache_manager_load_cache`
- `test_cache_manager_cache_cleanup`
- `test_cache_manager_error_handling`
- `test_cache_manager_concurrent_access`
- `test_cache_manager_performance`
- Updated `cache_manager` fixture

## Results
- **Before**: Tests hung indefinitely, required terminal kills
- **After**: Full test suite runs in 0.71 seconds
- **Memory leaks**: Eliminated
- **Background threads**: Prevented from starting
- **Network checks**: Mocked to avoid expensive I/O operations

## Key Takeaways
1. Always mock background thread creation in unit tests
2. Mock network availability checks to prevent I/O operations
3. Mock all initialization methods that perform expensive operations
4. Use proper cleanup in fixtures to ensure threads are stopped
5. Ensure daemon threads don't continue running after tests complete

The fix maintains test coverage while preventing expensive background operations that were causing memory leaks and slowdowns.
