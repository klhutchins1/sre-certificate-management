## 1. Purpose

The Infrastructure Management System (IMS) is a web-based platform designed to provide SREs and infrastructure teams with comprehensive visibility, tracking, and auditing of SSL/TLS certificates, hosts, and domains across diverse environments. The system's primary goal is to ensure that all certificates and their associations are monitored for compliance, expiration, and operational integrity, thereby reducing the risk of outages or security incidents due to certificate mismanagement.

**IMS is strictly a tracking and auditing tool; it does not automate certificate replacement, infrastructure modification, or certificate creation.**

---

## 2. High-Level Description

IMS is a single-page web application built with Streamlit, backed by a SQLite database managed via SQLAlchemy ORM. It provides a modern, interactive UI for managing certificates, hosts, domains, and their relationships. The system supports scanning of infrastructure to discover certificates, mapping them to hosts and domains, and tracking their lifecycle events. It also offers robust export, reporting, and alerting features, as well as configuration management via a YAML-based system.

---

## 3. Core Functionalities

### 3.1 Certificate Tracking and Management

- **View and Search Certificates:**  
  Users can browse, search, and filter all tracked SSL/TLS certificates. Each certificate record includes metadata such as serial number, thumbprint, issuer, subject, validity period, SANs, and scan history.
- **Status Tracking:**  
  Certificates are tracked for status (active, expired, pending renewal) and associated with hosts, domains, and applications.
- **Historical Tracking:**  
  The system maintains a history of certificate deployments, replacements (as tracked events), and changes, allowing users to audit the lifecycle of each certificate.
- **No Automation:**  
  IMS does not create, replace, or modify certificates; it only tracks and audits them.

### 3.2 Host and Domain Management

- **Host Inventory:**  
  Users can manage a list of physical and virtual hosts, including their type, environment, and associated IP addresses.
- **Domain Management:**  
  Domains and subdomains are tracked, including registration details, DNS records, and their relationships to certificates and hosts.
- **Infrastructure Mapping:**  
  The system visualizes and maps the relationships between certificates, hosts, IPs, domains, and applications, providing a clear view of dependencies and flows.

### 3.3 Scanning and Monitoring

- **Certificate Scanning:**  
  IMS can scan specified hosts and domains to discover and update certificate information, including SANs and hostnames.
- **Scan History:**  
  All scan events are recorded, including results, timestamps, and any errors encountered.
- **Alerting:**  
  The system generates alerts for approaching certificate expirations, scan failures, and other critical events, with configurable thresholds.

### 3.4 Exporting and Reporting

- **Data Export:**  
  Users can export certificate and host data in CSV or PDF formats, with customizable templates.
- **Reporting:**  
  The system provides timeline and chart visualizations of certificate validity, deployment history, and other key metrics.

### 3.5 Configuration and Customization

- **YAML-Based Configuration:**  
  All major settings (database paths, scanning profiles, alert thresholds, export settings) are managed via a YAML configuration file, with support for environment variable overrides.
- **Web-Based Editor:**  
  Users can edit configuration settings directly from the web interface.
- **Multiple Config Locations:**  
  Supports local, user, and system-wide configuration files.

### 3.6 Backup and Restore

- **Automated and Manual Backups:**  
  The system supports both scheduled and on-demand backups of the database and configuration files.
- **Backup Verification:**  
  Backups include manifests and can be verified for integrity.

---

## 4. User Interface

- **Dashboard:**  
  Provides an overview of certificate and host status, upcoming expirations, and key metrics.
- **Certificates View:**  
  Interactive table of all certificates, with advanced filtering, sorting, and detailed views.
- **Hosts View:**  
  AG Grid-based table of hosts, with real-time search, filtering, and color-coded status indicators.
- **Domains View:**  
  Management interface for domains and subdomains, including DNS and registration details.
- **Scanning Interface:**  
  Allows users to initiate scans, view progress, and review scan results.
- **History and Audit:**  
  Visualizes historical changes, scan events, and certificate lifecycle events.
- **Settings:**  
  Web-based configuration editor for all system settings.

---

## 5. Security and Access

- **Trusted Environment:**  
  The base version assumes a trusted environment and does not implement authentication or authorization.
- **Sensitive Data Handling:**  
  Certificates and related data are stored in SQLite without encryption by default.
- **Planned Enhancements:**  
  Future versions may include role-based access control, audit logging, and secure secret management.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Resilience

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  All scanning, database, and export operations include error handling and logging.
- **Alerting:**  
  Critical failures trigger alerts and are logged for review.
- **Planned Features:**  
  Transaction-safe imports, rollback capabilities, and audit trails are planned for future releases.

### 6.1 Exception Hierarchy

IMS uses a custom exception hierarchy (see `infra_mgmt/exceptions.py`) to ensure all domain-specific errors are handled in a structured and traceable way. This includes:
- `AppError`: Base class for all IMS errors
- `DatabaseError`: Database operation failures
- `BackupError`: Backup/restore operation failures
- `ScannerError`: Certificate/domain scan failures
- `CertificateError`: Certificate-specific errors
- `NotFoundError`: Resource not found
- `PermissionError`: Permission denied

**Guidelines:**
- Always raise the most specific exception for the error domain.
- Never raise the base `Exception` for domain-specific errors.
- Catch custom exceptions in business logic and UI for user-friendly error reporting.
- See the Design Document for full details and usage examples.

---

## 7. Performance and Scalability

- **Designed for Small-to-Medium Scale:**  
  The system is optimized for single-instance deployments using SQLite and Streamlit.
- **Efficient Data Handling:**  
  Utilizes AG Grid for responsive, large-table handling in the UI.
- **Planned Scalability:**  
  Future enhancements may include multi-instance support, database locking, and concurrent access handling.

---

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  Comprehensive test coverage for models, views, scanner, and settings.
- **Test Data:**  
  Includes test data for backup/restore and edge cases.
- **Error Scenario Coverage:**  
  Tests include error and edge case handling to ensure robustness.

---

## 9. Extensibility and Roadmap

- **Planned Features:**  
  - Data synchronization across environments
  - Advanced certificate validation (chain, revocation, OCSP)
  - Full-text search and bulk actions
  - CA management and JWT certificate support
  - Multi-instance deployment and robust locking
  - Audit trail and enhanced reporting

---

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Portability:**  
  Runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS with Python 3.8+.
- **Configurability:**  
  All major settings are user-configurable.
- **Maintainability:**  
  Codebase follows strict documentation and traceability standards.
- **Usability:**  
  Modern, responsive UI with clear navigation and actionable insights.

---

## 11. Out of Scope

- **Certificate Creation/Replacement:**  
  IMS does not automate or perform certificate creation, replacement, or infrastructure modification.
- **Untrusted Environments:**  
  No built-in authentication or encrypted storage in the base version.

---

## 12. Example Use Cases

- **SRE reviews all certificates expiring within 30 days and exports a report for compliance.**
- **Infrastructure team maps all hosts using a specific wildcard certificate.**
- **User scans a new host, reviews discovered certificates, and updates host associations.**
- **Administrator configures alert thresholds and backup schedules via the web interface.**
