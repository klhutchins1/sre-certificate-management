# Requirements Consolidation Summary

## ✅ Consolidated to Single Requirements File

We've successfully consolidated **5 different requirements files** down to **1 comprehensive `requirements.txt`**.

### 🗑️ Removed Files:
- `requirements_fixed.txt`
- `requirements_optimized.txt` ⚠️ (was missing critical dependencies)
- `requirements_complete_fixed.txt`
- `quick_fix_requirements.txt`

### ✅ Final Requirements File: `requirements.txt`

**Total packages: 132** (including all dependencies needed by the application)

### 🔍 Why the "Optimized" Version Was Broken:

The optimized requirements files removed critical dependencies that are actually used:

❌ **Missing but Required:**
- `altair==4.2.2` - Used in `infra_mgmt/views/applicationsView.py` 
- `memory_profiler==0.61.0` - Used in `tests/unit/test_views/test_scannerView.py`

❌ **Missing but Optional (with graceful fallbacks):**
- `matplotlib==3.7.5` - Used for chart generation in exports
- `weasyprint==61.2` - Used for PDF generation (has lazy loading)

### 📋 What's Included in Final Requirements:

✅ **Core Application:**
- Streamlit framework + aggrid
- Database: SQLAlchemy, alembic
- Networking: dnspython, requests, cryptography
- Data processing: pandas, numpy, plotly, altair

✅ **Testing Suite:**
- pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
- coverage, mock
- memory_profiler (for performance testing)

✅ **Optional Features:**
- matplotlib (chart generation)
- weasyprint (PDF generation) 
- Both whois packages for compatibility

✅ **Development Tools:**
- jupyter, ipython
- git integration
- vulture (dead code detection)

### 🎯 Result:
- **Single source of truth** for dependencies
- **All functionality preserved** 
- **No missing imports** 
- **Tests work properly**
- **Clean project structure**

The application now has one comprehensive, working requirements file! 🚀
