# WHOIS Compatibility Fix Summary

## Problem
The scanning functionality was failing with errors:
- `module 'whois' has no attribute 'whois'`
- `module 'whois' has no attribute 'parser'`

This occurred because the code expected the `python-whois` package but only the `whois` package was installed, which have incompatible APIs.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Package Detection (`domain_scanner.py`)
- **Dynamic whois package detection** that determines which package is available
- **Robust import handling** with try/except blocks to prevent import errors
- **Compatibility layer** that works with both `python-whois` and `whois` packages

### 2. Fixed Method Implementations
- **`_whois_query()` method**: Unified interface that handles both package types
- **`scan_domain()` method**: Fixed variable naming inconsistencies 
- **Exception handling**: Uses correct exception types for each package

### 3. Fixed Import Issues
- **Protected imports**: Added try/except around `whois.parser` imports
- **Fallback exceptions**: Uses generic Exception when PywhoisError is not available

### 4. Cache Management
- **Cache clearing script**: `clear_cache.py` to remove Python bytecode that may prevent updates

## Files Modified

1. **`infra_mgmt/scanner/domain_scanner.py`**
   - Enhanced whois compatibility layer
   - Fixed variable naming inconsistencies
   - Protected problematic imports

2. **`infra_mgmt/scanner/utils.py`**
   - Added whois compatibility for IP lookups

3. **`infra_mgmt/scanner/certificate_scanner.py`**
   - Added `offline_mode` parameter support

4. **`infra_mgmt/scanner/subdomain_scanner.py`**
   - Updated to pass `offline_mode` parameter

## User Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Python Cache
```bash
python3 clear_cache.py
```

### Step 2: Restart Your Application
- **For Streamlit**: Stop and restart with `streamlit run main.py`
- **For other applications**: Restart your Python process
- **For web servers**: Restart the web server

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
The system should now work with either:
- `python-whois==0.8.0` (preferred for full functionality)
- `whois==0.9.27` (basic functionality with subprocess fallback)

### Step 4: Check WHOIS Package Detection
The logs should show which package was detected:
```
[WHOIS] Starting query for domain.com using python-whois package
```
or
```
[WHOIS] Starting query for domain.com using whois package
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ With python-whois package:
- Full WHOIS functionality using native Python API
- Rich data extraction (registrar, registrant, dates, etc.)
- Proper exception handling with PywhoisError

### ✅ With whois package only:
- Basic WHOIS functionality using subprocess calls
- Limited data parsing from command-line output
- Graceful fallbacks when features aren't available

### ✅ With no whois package:
- WHOIS functionality disabled
- Scanning continues with other features (DNS, certificates)
- Clear logging about missing functionality

## Troubleshooting

### If errors persist:
1. **Check package installation**:
   ```bash
   pip show python-whois whois
   ```

2. **Force reinstall packages**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall whois python-whois
   pip install python-whois==0.8.0  # Recommended
   ```

3. **Check for multiple Python environments**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct virtual environment
   - Verify package installation in the active environment

4. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   python3 clear_cache.py
   find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
   find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```

### Error: "No module named 'dns'"
This indicates missing dependencies. Install with:
```bash
pip install dnspython
```

## Requirements File Compatibility

The fix works with any of these requirements configurations:

- **`requirements_complete_fixed.txt`**: Both packages (maximum compatibility)
- **`requirements_fixed.txt`**: Only whois package (basic functionality)
- **`requirements_optimized.txt`**: Only whois package (basic functionality)

## Testing

After applying the fix and restarting, test with a simple domain scan:
```python
from infra_mgmt.scanner.domain_scanner import DomainScanner
scanner = DomainScanner()
# This should work without throwing whois attribute errors
```

The scanning should now proceed without WHOIS-related errors, regardless of which whois package is installed.
