- [ ] `certificate_db.py` - Certificate database utilities
- [ ] `cache.py` - Caching utilities
- [ ] `SessionManager.py` - Session management

### Components Needing Tests:
- [ ] `components/deletion_dialog.py` - Deletion dialog
- [ ] `components/metrics_row.py` - Metrics display
- [ ] `components/page_header.py` - Page header

### Core Modules:
- [ ] `monitoring.py` - Monitoring utilities

---

## Test Configuration Updates

### Updated `pytest.ini`:
- Added coverage reporting with `--cov=infra_mgmt`
- Added HTML coverage reports: `--cov-report=html:htmlcov`
- Added XML coverage reports for CI integration
- Added branch coverage: `--cov-branch`
- Added term coverage report with missing lines: `--cov-report=term-missing`

### Coverage Configuration (`.coveragerc`):
Already configured to:
- Source: `infra_mgmt`
- Omit: tests, venv, `__init__.py` files
- Exclude: pragma no cover, repr methods, main blocks

---

## Running Tests

### Basic Commands:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_services/test_dashboard_service.py

# Run with detailed coverage report
pytest --cov=infra_mgmt --cov-report=html
```

### Coverage Reports:
After running tests, coverage reports are available:
- **HTML Report**: `htmlcov/index.html` - Open in browser for detailed coverage
- **Terminal Report**: Shown in test output
- **XML Report**: `coverage.xml` - For CI integration

---

## Test Quality Standards

### Test Requirements:
1. **Isolation**: All tests run with network isolation
2. **Speed**: Tests should run in < 100ms each
3. **Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ coverage for critical modules
4. **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to update when code changes

### Test Patterns:
- Use pytest fixtures for test data
- Mock external dependencies
- Test happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

---

## Completed in This Session

✅ **Created 4 additional service test files:**
   - `test_application_service.py` - 13 tests, 96% coverage
   - `test_base_service.py` - 7 tests, 91% coverage  
   - `test_view_data_service.py` - 12 tests
   - `test_optimized_database_service.py` - 18 tests (including QueryCache tests)

✅ **Total new tests added in this session: ~50 tests**

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Tests**:
   - Create tests for remaining utilities (dns_records, certificate_db, cache)
   - Create component tests
   - Add integration tests for critical workflows

2. **Improve Existing Tests**:
   - Review existing tests for completeness
   - Add edge case coverage
   - Improve error handling tests

3. **CI Integration**:
   - Set up coverage reporting in CI
   - Add coverage thresholds
   - Fail builds on coverage regression

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with testing instructions
   - Document test patterns and conventions
   - Create test examples for common scenarios

---

## Maintenance

### When Adding New Features:
1. Create test file: `test_<module_name>.py`
2. Write tests for all public methods
3. Test happy paths and error cases
4. Ensure tests pass before merging
5. Update this document if needed

### When Refactoring:
1. Update tests alongside code
2. Ensure tests still pass
3. Improve tests if needed
4. Don't delete tests unless functionality removed
