## Usage Guide

### Scanning Certificates
1. Navigate to "Scan" in the sidebar
2. Enter hostnames (one per line)
3. Click "Start Scan"
4. View results and any errors

### Viewing Certificates
1. Go to "Certificates" page
2. View list of all certificates
3. Select a certificate to see:
   - Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
   - Associated hosts
   - Detailed certificate information

### Managing Hosts
1. Access "Hosts" page
2. View hosts by IP address
3. Select an IP to see:
   - Associated hostnames
   - Certificates using this IP

### Dashboard
- View total certificates and hosts
- See certificates expiring soon
- Timeline of certificate validity periods
