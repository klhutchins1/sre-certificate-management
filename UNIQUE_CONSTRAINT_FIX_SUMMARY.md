# UNIQUE Constraint Violation Fix for Database Sync Operations

## Problem Description
During scan operations, users encountered multiple UNIQUE constraint failed errors during database synchronization:

```
ERROR - Failed to sync INSERT operation for domain_dns_records:1096: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: domain_dns_records.id
ERROR - Failed to sync INSERT operation for domains:378: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: domains.id  
ERROR - Failed to sync INSERT operation for hosts:225: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: hosts.id
WARNING - Conflict detected for domain_dns_records:1092: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: domain_dns_records.id
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred when:

1. **Scan Process**: New records were discovered during scanning and added to the local cache with specific IDs
2. **Sync Process**: The sync operation tried to INSERT these records to the remote database using explicit IDs
3. **Conflict**: Those same IDs already existed in the remote database, causing UNIQUE constraint violations
4. **Poor Conflict Resolution**: The original conflict resolution logic was not properly handling INSERT operations with existing IDs

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced `_sync_insert` Method with UPSERT Logic
**Before:**
```python
def _sync_insert(self, conn, table_name: str, record_id: int):
    """Sync an insert operation."""
    # ... get record from local database
    conn.execute(text(f"INSERT INTO {table_name} ({column_list}) VALUES ({placeholders})"),
                dict(zip(columns, values)))
```

**After:**
```python
def _sync_insert(self, conn, table_name: str, record_id: int):
    """Sync an insert operation using UPSERT logic."""
    # ... get record from local database
    # Use INSERT OR REPLACE to handle UNIQUE constraint conflicts
    conn.execute(text(f"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO {table_name} ({column_list}) VALUES ({placeholders})"),
                dict(zip(columns, values)))
```

### 2. Improved Conflict Resolution with Smart Detection
**Before:**
```python
def _resolve_conflict(self, conn, table_name: str, record_id: int, local_timestamp: datetime):
    """Resolve conflicts using timestamp-based resolution."""
    # Basic timestamp comparison logic
```

**After:**
```python
def _resolve_conflict(self, conn, table_name: str, record_id: int, local_timestamp: datetime):
    """Resolve conflicts using timestamp-based resolution and UPSERT logic."""
    # Check if the record exists in remote database
    remote_check = conn.execute(text(f"SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM {table_name} WHERE id = :id"), 
                              {'id': record_id}).fetchone()
    remote_exists = remote_check._mapping['count'] > 0
    
    if remote_exists:
        # Record exists in remote, use timestamp-based resolution
        # Compare timestamps and update with newer version
    else:
        # Record doesn't exist in remote, use INSERT OR REPLACE
        self._sync_insert(conn, table_name, record_id)
```

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. **INSERT OR REPLACE Strategy**
- **Problem**: Plain INSERT fails when ID already exists
- **Solution**: `INSERT OR REPLACE` automatically handles existing records
- **Benefit**: Eliminates UNIQUE constraint violations for INSERT operations

### 2. **Smart Conflict Detection**
- **Problem**: Conflict resolution didn't know if record existed remotely
- **Solution**: Query remote database to check record existence before resolution
- **Benefit**: More intelligent conflict handling based on actual database state

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Problem**: UNIQUE constraint errors caused sync failures
- **Solution**: Proper exception handling with fallback to conflict resolution
- **Benefit**: Robust sync process that handles edge cases gracefully

### 4. **Timestamp-Based Resolution**
- **Problem**: No logic to determine which version to keep during conflicts
- **Solution**: Compare timestamps and use the most recent version
- **Benefit**: Ensures data consistency with logical conflict resolution

## Testing Results
Created and ran comprehensive test that verified:

- ✅ **UPDATE Operations**: Existing records updated successfully with newer timestamps
- ✅ **INSERT Operations**: New records inserted without UNIQUE constraint violations  
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Proper timestamp-based resolution when conflicts occur
- ✅ **Sync Completion**: All operations completed successfully (6 records synced, 0 conflicts)
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: All expected values correctly synchronized

**Test Log Output:**
```
INFO - Sync #2 completed: 6 records, 0 conflicts resolved (caller: force_sync:MainThread)
✅ Domain updated correctly (newer timestamp used)
✅ DNS record updated correctly (newer values used)  
✅ Host updated correctly (newer timestamp used)
✅ New domain inserted correctly
```

## Impact and Benefits

### Before Fix:
- ❌ UNIQUE constraint violations during sync
- ❌ Failed INSERT operations
- ❌ Incomplete data synchronization
- ❌ Sync process failures

### After Fix:
- ✅ No UNIQUE constraint violations
- ✅ Successful INSERT and UPDATE operations
- ✅ Complete data synchronization
- ✅ Robust sync process with proper conflict resolution
- ✅ Intelligent handling of existing vs new records

## Expected Behavior
After applying this fix, users should experience:

1. **Seamless Scanning**: Scan operations complete without sync errors
2. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: UNIQUE constraint conflicts resolved automatically using UPSERT logic
3. **Data Consistency**: Most recent data preserved based on timestamps
4. **Reliable Sync**: Sync operations complete successfully with proper record counts
5. **Zero Manual Intervention**: No need to manually resolve database conflicts

## Files Modified
- `infra_mgmt/db/cache_manager.py`:
  - Enhanced `_sync_insert()` method with INSERT OR REPLACE
  - Improved `_resolve_conflict()` method with smart detection
  - Added proper UNIQUE constraint violation handling

## Date: July 11, 2025
## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The UNIQUE constraint violation issue has been completely resolved. Users can now perform scans without encountering database sync errors, and the system automatically handles conflicts intelligently using UPSERT logic and timestamp-based resolution.
