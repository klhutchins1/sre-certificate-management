# Security Template for Certificate Management System

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

This template provides guidance for securing your Certificate Management System deployment. **Review and implement these security measures before using this system in production.**

## 1. Repository Security

### Before First Commit
- [ ] Replace all placeholder values in documentation (`[YOUR_USERNAME]`, `[YOUR_REPO_NAME]`)
- [ ] Review all configuration files for sensitive information
- [ ] Ensure `.env` files are created and added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Check that no internal URLs, IP addresses, or credentials are committed
- [ ] Consider making the repository private if it contains sensitive infrastructure information

### Git Best Practices
- Use generic commit messages (avoid internal URLs, usernames, infrastructure details)
- Never commit credentials, API keys, or internal network information
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly audit repository for sensitive information
- Consider using pre-commit hooks to catch sensitive data

## 2. Configuration Security

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file (not committed to git) with:
```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/your/database.db
BACKUP_PATH=/path/to/your/backups

# Network Configuration
INTERNAL_PROXY_HOST=your-proxy-host
INTERNAL_PROXY_PORT=your-proxy-port
EXTERNAL_PROXY_HOST=your-external-proxy
EXTERNAL_PROXY_PORT=your-external-proxy-port

# API Keys (if applicable)
WHOIS_API_KEY=your-whois-api-key
DNS_API_KEY=your-dns-api-key

# Security Settings
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

### Configuration Files
- Use `config.yaml` for non-sensitive configuration
- Use `config.local.yaml` for sensitive configuration (add to `.gitignore`)
- Never commit actual credentials or internal URLs

## 3. Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- Ensure internal services are not exposed to the internet
- Use VPN for remote access to internal systems
- Configure proper firewall rules for your infrastructure
- Regularly audit network access and permissions

### Service Security
- Change default ports for internal services
- Use strong authentication for all services
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

## 4. Data Security

### Database Security
- Use encrypted database connections when possible
- Implement proper backup encryption
- Restrict database access to authorized users only
- Regularly audit database access logs

### Certificate Management
- Secure storage of private keys and certificates
- Implement proper certificate lifecycle management
- Use secure channels for certificate distribution
- Regular security audits of certificate inventory

## 5. Access Control

### User Management
- Implement role-based access control
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication where possible
- Regular user access reviews

### Audit Logging
- Enable comprehensive audit logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Regular review of access logs
- Implement alerting for security events

## 6. Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor for failed login attempts
- Track unusual access patterns
- Alert on security-related events
- Regular security assessments

### Backup Security
- Encrypt backup data
- Secure backup storage locations
- Test backup and recovery procedures
- Regular backup integrity checks

## 7. Incident Response

### Security Incident Plan
- Document incident response procedures
- Establish communication protocols
- Define escalation procedures
- Regular incident response drills

### Recovery Procedures
- Document recovery procedures
- Test recovery processes regularly
- Maintain offline recovery documentation
- Regular disaster recovery testing

## 8. Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- Follow industry security best practices
- Implement relevant security frameworks
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

### Documentation
- Maintain security documentation
- Regular security policy reviews
- Update procedures as needed
- Security awareness training

## 9. Checklist for Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Security review of all configuration
- [ ] Network security assessment
- [ ] Access control implementation
- [ ] Backup and recovery testing
- [ ] Security monitoring setup

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Security monitoring verification
- [ ] Access control testing
- [ ] Backup verification
- [ ] Security incident response testing
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled

## 10. Contact Information
