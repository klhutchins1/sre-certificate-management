# Proxy Certificate Deduplication Solution

## Problem Description

You identified a critical issue with proxy certificates:

> "I have old certificates in the list with different serial numbers, but they have the same expiration date with that shows a proxy CA and it's being marked as different certificates. The existing certificate has been replaced so, I'm unable to go back and scan it for real and mark it as a proxy certificate. We need a way to ensure that if the CA is a cert created by a proxy, that we can have it merge with the other certificates that are probably the same thing. This makes it hard when all the info that should be unique (serial, thumbprint) gets generated on the fly and messes this data up."

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
1. **Proxy certificates are generated on-the-fly** with different serial numbers and thumbprints
2. **Same CA, same expiration date, same target** but different "unique" identifiers
3. **Database treats them as separate certificates** when they're essentially the same
4. **Data integrity issues** - related data (bindings, scans, tracking) gets split across duplicates
5. **Cannot retroactively scan** the original certificates to mark them as proxy certificates

### Why This Happens
- **TLS Interception**: Corporate proxies generate new certificates for each connection
- **Dynamic Generation**: Each proxy certificate has a unique serial number/thumbprint
- **Same CA Root**: All generated certificates are signed by the same proxy CA
- **Same Target**: They're all for the same target domain/hostname
- **Same Expiration**: They typically have the same validity period

## Solution Overview

I've created a comprehensive deduplication system that:

1. **Identifies duplicate proxy certificates** based on common characteristics
2. **Merges related data** (bindings, scans, tracking) to maintain data integrity
3. **Marks certificates as proxied** with detailed information
4. **Preserves the oldest certificate** and removes newer duplicates
5. **Provides safe dry-run mode** for testing before making changes

## Files Created

### 1. `proxy_certificate_deduplication.py`
**Basic deduplication script** that:
- Identifies duplicate proxy certificates
- Merges certificates only (no related data)
- Simple and fast for basic cleanup

### 2. `proxy_certificate_deduplication_advanced.py`
**Advanced deduplication script** that:
- Identifies duplicate proxy certificates
- Migrates all related data (bindings, scans, tracking)
- Maintains complete data integrity
- Recommended for production use

## How It Works

### 1. Detection Algorithm
The scripts identify duplicate proxy certificates by grouping them based on:

```python
group_key = f"{issuer_cn}|{cn}|{valid_until}"
```

This groups certificates that have:
- **Same CA issuer** (proxy CA)
- **Same common name** (target domain)
- **Same expiration date**

### 2. Proxy CA Detection
Certificates are identified as proxy certificates if:

1. **Configured CA subjects** match (from `config.yaml`)
2. **Common proxy indicators** are found in the CA name:
   - `proxy`, `corporate`, `internal`, `firewall`, `gateway`
   - `bluecoat`, `zscaler`, `forcepoint`

### 3. Merging Strategy
- **Keep the oldest certificate** (earliest `created_at`)
- **Remove newer duplicates**
- **Migrate all related data** to the kept certificate
- **Mark as proxied** with detailed information

## Usage Examples

### Basic Deduplication (Simple)
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be done
python proxy_certificate_deduplication.py --dry-run

# Actually perform deduplication
python proxy_certificate_deduplication.py

# Use with specific database path
python proxy_certificate_deduplication.py --db-path \\\\server\\share\\certificates.db
```

### Advanced Deduplication (Recommended)
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be done
python proxy_certificate_deduplication_advanced.py --dry-run

# Actually perform deduplication with data migration
python proxy_certificate_deduplication_advanced.py

# Force execution without confirmation
python proxy_certificate_deduplication_advanced.py --force
```

## Configuration

### Proxy CA Detection
Configure your proxy CA subjects in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
proxy_detection:
  ca_subjects:
    - "Corporate Proxy CA"
    - "BlueCoat ProxySG CA"
    - "Zscaler Root CA"
    - "Forcepoint SSL CA"
```

### Automatic Detection
The scripts also detect common proxy indicators:
- `proxy`, `corporate`, `internal`, `firewall`, `gateway`
- `bluecoat`, `zscaler`, `forcepoint`

## Safety Features

### 1. Dry Run Mode
- **Always run with `--dry-run` first** to see what would be done
- **No changes made** during dry run
- **Detailed analysis** of what would be merged

### 2. Confirmation Prompts
- **Interactive confirmation** before making changes
- **Summary of actions** to be performed
- **Option to cancel** if not satisfied

### 3. Transaction Safety
- **Database transactions** ensure atomic operations
- **Rollback on errors** to prevent partial changes
- **Data integrity** maintained throughout the process

### 4. Data Preservation
- **All related data migrated** to kept certificates
- **No data loss** during deduplication
- **Complete audit trail** of what was merged

## Data Integrity

### What Gets Migrated
1. **Certificate Bindings** - Host associations, ports, applications
2. **Certificate Scans** - Scan history, status, dates
3. **Certificate Tracking** - Change tracking, notes, status

### What Gets Preserved
1. **Oldest certificate** (earliest creation date)
2. **All related data** from duplicate certificates
3. **Proxy detection information** with merge details

### What Gets Removed
1. **Newer duplicate certificates** only
2. **No data loss** - everything is migrated first

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Test First
```bash
# Always run dry-run first
python proxy_certificate_deduplication_advanced.py --dry-run
```

### 2. Backup Your Database
```bash
# Create a backup before running
cp data/certificates.db data/certificates.db.backup.$(date +%s)
```

### 3. Use Advanced Script
- **Use the advanced script** for production databases
- **Simple script** only for basic cleanup
- **Advanced script** maintains complete data integrity

### 4. Monitor Results
- **Check the summary** after deduplication
- **Verify data integrity** in your application
- **Review proxy detection** is working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. No Duplicates Found
```
‚úÖ No duplicate proxy certificates found!
```
**Solution**: This is normal if you don't have proxy certificates or duplicates.

#### 2. Database Locked
```
‚ùå Database is locked. Please ensure no other applications are using it.
```
**Solution**: Close any applications using the database and try again.

#### 3. Permission Errors
```
‚ùå Cannot open database. Check file permissions and path.
```
**Solution**: Check file permissions and ensure you have write access.

#### 4. Network Path Issues
```
‚ùå Error: Database file not found at \\server\share\certificates.db
```
**Solution**: Verify network connectivity and path accessibility.

### Recovery

#### Restore from Backup
```bash
# If something goes wrong, restore from backup
cp data/certificates.db.backup.TIMESTAMP data/certificates.db
```

#### Verify Data Integrity
```sql
-- Check that certificates still exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificates;

-- Check that bindings are intact
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificate_bindings;

-- Check proxy certificates
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificates WHERE proxied = 1;
```

## Integration with Existing System

### 1. Works with Migration
- **Run after database migration** to clean up existing duplicates
- **Compatible with proxy detection** migration scripts
- **No conflicts** with existing proxy detection features

### 2. Ongoing Maintenance
- **Run periodically** to clean up new duplicates
