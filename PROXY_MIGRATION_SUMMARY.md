# Proxy Detection Database Migration - Summary

## Problem Solved

You were getting SQL errors like:
```
SQL Insert or replace into certificates, no column named proxied
```

This happened because your existing database didn't have the proxy detection columns that the new code expects.

## Solution Provided

I've created a comprehensive migration system to add the missing columns to your existing database:

### Files Created

1. **`migrate_proxy_detection.py`** - Main migration script (reads from config.yaml)
2. **`migrate_remote_database.py`** - Enhanced script for remote/network databases
3. **`run_with_migration.py`** - Application launcher with automatic migration
4. **`test_migration.py`** - Test script to verify migration works
5. **`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### Columns Added

- `proxied` (BOOLEAN, default: FALSE) - Indicates if certificate is from proxy
- `proxy_info` (TEXT, nullable) - Detailed proxy detection information

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Automatic Migration (Recommended)

```bash
python run_with_migration.py
```

This will automatically migrate your database and start your application.

### Option 2: Manual Migration (Local/Network)

```bash
python migrate_proxy_detection.py
```

This will migrate your database using the path from `config.yaml`.

### Option 3: Remote Database Migration

```bash
python migrate_remote_database.py
```

This is specifically designed for databases on network shares with enhanced error handling.

### Option 4: Verify Only

```bash
python migrate_proxy_detection.py --verify-only
```

This will check if migration is already applied.

## What the Migration Does

1. **Reads database path from config.yaml** - No more hardcoded paths!
2. **Creates a backup** of your existing database
3. **Adds the missing columns** (`proxied` and `proxy_info`)
4. **Preserves all existing data** (no data loss)
5. **Verifies the migration** was successful
6. **Shows you the results**

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ **Non-destructive** - Only adds columns, never removes data
- ‚úÖ **Automatic backup** - Creates timestamped backup before changes
- ‚úÖ **Verification** - Checks that migration worked correctly
- ‚úÖ **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
- ‚úÖ **Tested** - Migration script has been tested and verified
- ‚úÖ **Config-aware** - Reads database path from your config.yaml
- ‚úÖ **Network support** - Enhanced scripts for remote databases

## Example Output

## Remote Database Support

The migration scripts now support remote databases and network shares:

### Network Path Detection
- Automatically detects network paths (UNC paths like `\\server\share`)
- Provides helpful troubleshooting for network issues
- Uses longer timeouts for network databases

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages for network connectivity issues
- Database locking detection and suggestions
- Permission error handling

### Backup Location
- Creates backups in the same directory as the database
- Works with network shares and mapped drives

## After Migration

1. **Your existing certificates** remain unchanged (all have `proxied=FALSE`)
2. **New certificates** will be checked for proxy indicators
3. **Proxy detection features** are now available
4. **No more SQL errors** about missing columns

## Testing

The migration has been tested and verified to work correctly:

```bash
python test_migration.py
```

This creates a test database, runs the migration, and verifies everything works.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** using one of the options above
2. **Restart your application** (if using manual migration)
3. **Configure proxy detection** in your `config.yaml` if needed
4. **Start scanning certificates** - proxy detection will now work

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the backup** was created (look for `.backup.TIMESTAMP` files)
2. **Run verification** with `--verify-only` flag
3. **Restore from backup** if needed
4. **Check the MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting

### Network-Specific Issues

For remote databases:
1. **Check network connectivity** to the database location
2. **Verify permissions** on the network share
3. **Try mapping the network drive** if using UNC paths
4. **Use the remote migration script** for better error handling

## Files to Use

- **For automatic migration**: `run_with_migration.py`
- **For local databases**: `migrate_proxy_detection.py`
- **For remote/network databases**: `migrate_remote_database.py`
- **For testing**: `test_migration.py`
- **For documentation**: `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

## Configuration Integration

The migration scripts now properly integrate with your existing configuration:

- **Reads database path** from `config.yaml` under `paths.database`
- **Handles relative paths** correctly
- **Supports network paths** and UNC paths
- **Works with your existing setup** without manual path specification

The migration is designed to be safe, simple, and reliable. Your existing data will be preserved, and you'll be able to use all the new proxy detection features immediately after migration.
